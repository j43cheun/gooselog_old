I'm a Canadian software developer based in the Greater Seattle area in WA
state. I'm originally from Toronto, ON, Canada.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Microsoft on the Hyper-V
Resource Management and Security (RMS) Team. Prior to this, I was a software
engineer on the Storage Spaces Dev Team at Microsoft, where I worked on storage
management and storage virtualization for Windows client, Windows Server, and
Azure Stack HCI.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, photography, playing video games, and watching
anime and movies. My goto camera is the Sony α7 III and my favorite video games
are the Pokémon main series titles and Animal Crossing.

My favorite animal is the Canada Goose.
